Babble integration with ActionBar
=================================

Introduction
------------

actionbar.babble is the Babble chat client integration package for 
the ActionBar, an extensible floating panel with links at the 
bottom of your Plone site.

For more information regarding Babble and ActionBar, please see their
respective packages: *babble.client*, *babble.server* and *actionbar.panel*.


How to use
----------

Just install actionbar.babble via the Plone control panel, or the
*portal_quickinstaller* tool. *actionbar.panel* and *babble.client* will be 
installed automatically as well.

Make sure that the portal_chat tool for *babble.client* is configured correctly.

You should now automatically have the ActionBar at
the bottom of your Plone site. At the bottom right, you will see a section
called *Online Users*. Clicking on it will popup a dialog showing all the
current online users you can chat with.
