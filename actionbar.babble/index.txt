Babble integration with ActionBar
=================================

Introduction
------------

*actionbar.babble* is the **Babble** chat client's integration package for 
the **ActionBar**, an extensible floating panel with links at the 
bottom of your Plone site.

For more information regarding Babble and ActionBar, please see their
respective packages: *babble.client*, *babble.server* and *actionbar.panel*.

How to use
----------

Just install actionbar.babble via the Plone control panel, or the
*portal_quickinstaller* tool. *actionbar.panel* and *babble.client* will be 
installed automatically as well.

Make sure that the portal_chat tool for *babble.client* is configured correctly.

You should now automatically have the ActionBar at
the bottom of your Plone site. At the bottom right, you will see a section
called *Online Users*. Clicking on it will popup a dialog showing all the
current online users you can chat with.

Troubleshooting:
----------------

**1. The *Online Users* box, and the individual chatboxes appear slightly lower 
and behind the ActionBar panel. When you minimize a box, it disappears behind the panel.**

 Make sure that the babblefeeder.css file is loaded *after* the chat.css file
 in the portal_css resource registry in the Zope management interface.
 You can do this by hand, or simply re-run the actionbar.babble CSS import step
 in the portal_setup tool.
