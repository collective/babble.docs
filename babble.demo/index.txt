Setting up a quick chat demo
============================

Introduction
------------

*babble.demo* sets up a fully configured and running Babble instant messaging
environment for Plone.

It's intended as a demo and aid to help integrators familiarise themselves with
how Babble works and what it has to offer.

All the eggs (currently) related to Babble are installed. These are:

- `babble.server <http://plone.org/products/babble.server>`_: 
   - The Zope messaging service. This service should ideally be run in it's
     own dedicated server or Zeo client (as in this case).
- `babble.client <http://plone.org/products/babble.client>`_: 
   - The Plone client side program. This provides the main chat functionality 
     such as the *online contacts* portlet and the chat boxes.
- `actionbar.panel <http://plone.org/products/actionbar.panel>`_:
   - This add-on is not directly associated with Babble and is not a
     requirement of it. It provides an extendablee action panel that hovers at 
     the bottom of the screen.
- `actionbar.babble <http://plone.org/products/actionbar.babble>`_:
   - The Babble extention for actionbar.panel. It provides a special
     action-box that provides a list of currently online users. Additionally,
     chatboxes are docked on this panel.


Steps to get a running system:
------------------------------

I assume here that *python* is python version 2.6.* with PIL (the python
imaging library) installed::

    python bootstrap.py -c plone4.cfg

    ./bin/buildout -c plone4.cfg

The buildout will install a Zeo server running on port 2000 with two clients, 
*instance* on port 8080 and *chatserver* on port 8081.

*supervisor* is installed to manage these processes. After the buildout has
completed succesfully, start the supervisor::

    ./bin/supervisord

You can check on the commandline wether the processes started succesfully::

    ./bin/supervisorctl status

Or in your browser by visiting http://localhost:9000, with username and
password 'admin'.

Now, in your browser, go to http://localhost:8080, and click on the *Create a 
new Plone site* button. In the next page, choose babble.demo from the list of
'add-ons' and then click *Create Plone site*.

Babble and the ActionBar should now be installed and correctly configured.

Now head to http://localhost:8080/Plone/@@usergroup-userprefs, and add some
users.
