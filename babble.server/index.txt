Babble messaging server
=======================

Introduction
------------

**babble.server** is a messaging service for Zope2 based systems.

It's the messaging server used by *babble.client*, an instant messaging
client for Plone. However, it doesn't have any dependencies on Plone or
*babble.client* and is designed to be usable independent of the frontend client.

Features
--------

- **User accounts:** users must be registered for the chat service
- **Security:** most messaging actions requires the user to authenticate 
- **User status support:** users can set their status, such as 'busy', 'chatty' or
  'invisible'.
- **Web service:** all public API methods return JSON strings.
- **Tests:** 100% test coverage.

Usage
-----

Simply add the *Chat Service* in the ZMI (Zope Management Interface) by clicking
on the dropdown box and choosing it from the list.
