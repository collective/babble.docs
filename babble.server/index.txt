Babble messaging server
=======================

Introduction
------------

**babble.server** is a messaging service for Zope2 based systems.

It's the messaging server used by *babble.client*, an instant messaging
client for Plone. However, it doesn't have any dependencies on Plone or
*babble.client* and is designed to be usable independent of the frontend client.

Features
--------

- **User accounts:** users must be registered for the chat service
- **Security:** most messaging actions requires the user to authenticate 
- **User status support:** users can set their status, such as 'busy', 'chatty' or
  'invisible'.
- **Web service:** all public API methods return JSON strings.
- **Tests:** 100% test coverage.


Setup
-----

The chatserver is designed to be a standalone and lightweight Zope2 app. It doesn't depend
on Plone at all.

The best way to create a chatserver is as a Zeo client.

Note: It's important to include the zcml slug for babble.server.

For example::

    [buildout]
    parts += chatserver

    [chatserver]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    http-address = 0.0.0.0:8081
    user = admin:admin
    shared-blob = on
    zeo-address = ${zeo:zeo-address}
    zeo-client = on
    eggs = babble.server
    zcml = babble.server


Usage
-----

Simply add the *Chat Service* in the ZMI (Zope Management Interface) by clicking
on the dropdown box and choosing it from the list.
